## Description

This repository aims to replicate the [Generative Recommenders](https://github.com/facebookresearch/generative-recommenders) using Lightning and Hydra. It hosts the code for the paper ["Actions Speak Louder than Words: Trillion-Parameter Sequential Transducers for Generative Recommendations"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17152). While primarily intended for personal learning, this repository offers several key features:

- **Efficient Training & Inference**: enhances training and inference speed by optimizing GPU utilization. As a result, the training of the MovieLens-1M dataset over 100 epochs can now be completed in under 10 minutes on a single 4090 or L4 machine.
- **Experimentation Made Easy**: Easily manage and create hierarchical configurations with overrides via config files and command-line options to support various experiments.
- **Modular Configuration**: Dynamically instantiate objects through configuration files, allowing seamless switching between different datasets or modules without extensive rewriting.
- **Hardware Agnostic**: The dependency on NVIDIA GPUs has been removed, enabling you to run the scripts on any device, including local machines for training, evaluation, and debugging.
- **Improved Readability**: The code has been significantly refactored for clarity. The Generative Recommenders module is now divided into four major components: embeddings, preprocessor, sequence encoder, and postprocessor, making the training and evaluation processes more transparent.

## Env

A100 40G, CUDA 12.4, Ubuntu 22.04

## Installation

It is recommended to use `uv` to install the library:

```bash
uv venv -p 3.12 && source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync --extra=cu124
```

## How to Run

Prepare dataset based on configs/data, first build pre-train dataset, then build tuning dataset

example:

```bash
make prepare_data data=amazon_books
make prepare_data data=serenlens_books
```

Train the Model with Default Configuration

```bash
# Train on CPU
make train trainer=cpu

# Train on GPU
make train trainer=gpu
```

Train the Model with a Specific Experiment Configuration. Choose an experiment configuration from [configs/experiment/](configs/experiment/):

```bash
make train experiment=ml-1m-hstu
```

Evaluate the Model with a Given Checkpoint

```bash
make eval ckpt_path=example_checkpoint.pt
```

Predict the Model with a Given Checkpoint

```bash
make predict ckpt_path=example_checkpoint.pt output_file=example_output.csv
```

Override Parameters from the Command Line

```bash
make train trainer.max_epochs=20 data.batch_size=64
```

## Experiment Result:

### MovieLens-1M (ML-1M)

To ensure reproducibility and eliminate randomization, the sample in the dataset generation was removed, and the seed in training was set to 42.
